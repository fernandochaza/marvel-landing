            Groot is a Flora colossus from Planet X, the capital of the branch
            worlds. The Flora colossi are tree-like beings whose language is
            almost impossible to understand due to the stiffness of their
            larynxes, causing their speech to sound like they are repeating the
            phrase "I am Groot". Other beings try to be friendly but become
            angry with the Flora colossi for their apparent inability to speak,
            though Groot was shown to have been actually speaking not just
            understandably but eloquently in his language throughout
            Annihilation: Conquest. <br /><br />
            The Flora colossi are ruled over by the "Arbor Masters" and teach
            the children of the species with "Photonic Knowledge", which is the
            collected knowledge of the Arbor Masters of the generations and is
            absorbed through photosynthesis; this is a highly advanced education
            method, making the Flora colossi geniuses.

            Groot is the accomplice of Rocket Raccoon. Together, the pair had
            traveled the galaxy picking up bounties until they met Star-Lord and
            Gamora just before the four of them were captured and put into the
            Kyln, where they also met Drax the Destroyer. There, they agreed to
            work together to escape and sell the Orb for a massive profit.
            However, when it was discovered that the Orb contained one of the
            Infinity Stones which was being sought out by Ronan the Accuser,
            Groot convinced his friends to risk everything to stop Ronan's
            diabolical plans.

            During the Battle of Xandar, Groot sacrificed his own life to save
            his new friends. However, part of his destroyed body was planted by
            Rocket to birth a new Groot, as they joined the Guardians of the
            Galaxy.
          </p>

          <p class="article-text">
            As the new Groot began to grow, he stayed with the Guardians and
            endeavored with them on many adventures. They were soon hired by the
            Sovereign to destroy an Abilisk, but they were then targeted by
            their former employers due to Rocket who double-crossed them.
          </p>

          <p class="article-text">
            During the escape, they had met Peter Quill's father Ego while Groot
            and Rocket, along with Yondu Udonta, were captured by Taserface's
            faction of the Ravagers, but Groot was able to help them all escape.
            Groot then joined his allies and assisted them in destroying Ego and
            saving all his friends, but Udonta died. Over the next four years,
            Groot continued to grow and started exhibiting the personality of an
            adolescent.

            Flora colossus Physiology: Groot is a Flora colossus, an ancient
            race of tree-like humanoid beings, with superhuman abilities. As a
            tree-like being, he could manipulate his body to grow limbs. They
            also grow at a faster rate than normal humans, as Groot grew from a
            baby to a teenager in the span of 4 years. A Flora colossus can also
            be planted back to life with remaining twigs to give birth to a new
            Flora colossus, although as an offspring it will not retain the
            memories or personality of the original.

            Superhuman Strength: Groot meets Steve Rogers Groot lifts three
            Outriders Groot is capable of great feats of strength, from breaking
            sturdy metal items to fighting other strong opponents and lifting
            and flailing around ten armored warriors with comparative ease. As
            Baby Groot, he was able to strangle the larger Retch with his vines
            before throwing him off the catwalk, killing him upon the impact. He
            was also able to impale three Outriders with his branches and lift
            them effortlessly. He could even pull a branch off of a tree while
            still in his baby pot.

            Superhuman Durability: The skin of Groot is composed entirely of a
            dense and durable wood, thus allowing him to easily sustain large
            amounts of damage from firearms, melee weapons and explosions. He
            can easily hold against several blows of Gamora's sword, various
            shots of the Kyln Hoverbots, multiple punches from Drax, and
            Sakaarans' attacks. He also withstood many shots by the Grunds.
